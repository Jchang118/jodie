## Control flow statement

#### 1. continue

*continue* can only be used within loops. If further iterations are possible, it directly proceeds to the next iteration; otherwise, it ends the loop.

#### 2. break

*break* is primarily used in loops, but it also frequently appears in *switch* statements, to break out of the loop.

#### 3. return

*return* completely exits the function.

If your function definition requires returning a value, then a return value must be provided. See [09 Functions](09%20Functions%20in%20C++.md#^131a42)

These control flow statements control the execution of the program.

These loops, control flows, and conditional statements (such as if statements) are the essence of [logical programming](12%20CONDITIONS%20and%20BRANCHES%20in%20C++.md#^2780f2).
