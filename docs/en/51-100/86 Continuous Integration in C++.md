## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared main branch or repository, often multiple times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build process (including compilation, deployment, and testing) to detect and fix integration errors as early as possible.

The main benefits of CI include:

1. **Rapid Error Detection**: Frequent integration of new code with the existing codebase allows for quick identification and resolution of errors.
2. **Improved Code Quality**: Continuous integration and testing help ensure the quality of the code, as all changes are subjected to testing.
3. **Reduced Manual Testing**: Automated testing reduces the need for manual testing, saving time and human resources.
4. **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: With CI, team members know that the main branch is always up-to-date and functional, which facilitates smoother collaboration.

Common CI tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and others.
